# General Info

When watching a movie with Polish subtitles on a system without Polish language installed all the characters specific
 to the Polish langugage are displayed as "\uFFFD" or substituted by a random character outside ASCII code. This 
 obviously disturbs the reading flow (which is crucial when you watch a movie in a foreign language) and takes away a
  little bit of pleasure. 
  
  This simple app tries to remedy that by replacing all the diacritic characters by the  closest equivalent in the 
  ASCII range. For example "ą" is replaced by "a", "ś" by "s", "ł" by "l" and so on, and so forth.
